Hoover Dishwasher Part
======================

This is the OpenSCAD file to replace a broken part of my Hoover
dishwasher.

In the image below you see the arm from my dishwasher (top), the broken
part (right) and the 3D print I used to replace it (left). This piece
was printed in nylon which worked very well, and was printed at
[Southampton Makerspace](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/)

So far so good; works brilliantly and seems considerably stronger than
the one that came with the dishwasher.

[This is the kit][Hoover part] I could have got from Hoover instead if I
just wanted it to last another 1.5 years before breaking again.
